# Q-Rank
Reinforcement Learning for Recommending Algorithms to Predict Drug Sensitivity to Cancer Therapy

Q-Rank, is a new appraoch to predict the sensitivity of cell lines to anticancer drugs. Q-Rank integrates different prediction algorithms and identifies a suitable algorithm for a given application. Q-Rank is based on reinforcement learning mechanisms to rank the
prediction algorithms on the basis of relevant features (e.g., omics characterization). The best-ranked algorithm is recommended
and used to predict response to therapy. 

The file list is shown as following:
1. RL_using_package.R -- environment  simulator & policy search.
2. rl.R -- envirement_preparation (states, actions)
3. reward.R-- compute reward 
4. globalFunctions.R 
5. test.r -- example
